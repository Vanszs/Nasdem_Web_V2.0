## TypeScript Errors

### UserRole Enum Issues

**Problem**: Many API routes were using string literals for roles instead of the UserRole enum, causing TypeScript errors.

**Solution**: Added import for UserRole enum and replaced string literals with enum values.

**Files Fixed**:
- `app/api/auth/login/route.ts`
- `app/api/auth/logout/route.ts`
- `app/api/users/route.ts`
- `app/api/users/[id]/route.ts`
- `app/api/members/route.ts`
- `app/api/members/[id]/route.ts`
- `app/api/news/route.ts`
- `app/api/news/[id]/route.ts`
- `app/api/upload/route.ts`

**Example Fix**:
```typescript
// Before
const roleError = requireRole(req, ["editor", "superadmin"]);

// After
const roleError = requireRole(req, [UserRole.EDITOR, UserRole.SUPERADMIN]);
```

### Type Assertion Issues

**Problem**: Some type assertions were missing or incorrect, causing TypeScript errors.

**Solution**: Added proper type assertions where needed.

**Files Fixed**:
- `app/api/auth/login/route.ts`
- `lib/rbac.ts`
- `lib/jwt-middleware.ts`

## Import/Export Issues

### Missing Imports

**Problem**: Several files were missing imports for UserRole enum and other dependencies.

**Solution**: Added missing imports to all affected files.

### Validation Schema Issues

**Problem**: There was a typo in the role enum value ("analist" instead of "analyst").

**Solution**: Fixed the typo in all validation schemas.

**Files Fixed**:
- `lib/validation.ts`

## Role-Based Access Control Fixes

### Permission Checks

**Problem**: Some API routes were missing proper role-based access control checks.

**Solution**: Added role checks to all API routes that were missing them.

**Files Fixed**:
- `app/api/members/[id]/route.ts`
- `app/api/news/[id]/route.ts`

### Error Handling in RBAC

**Problem**: The RBAC system was throwing custom errors that weren't being handled properly.

**Solution**: Replaced custom error throwing with NextResponse.json returns.

**Files Fixed**:
- `lib/jwt-middleware.ts`
- `app/api/users/[id]/route.ts`
- `app/api/members/[id]/route.ts`
- `app/api/news/[id]/route.ts`

## Error Handling Fixes

### Custom Error Classes

**Problem**: Custom error classes (ValidationError, NotFoundError, etc.) were being used but not properly imported or handled.

**Solution**: Replaced custom error throwing with standard NextResponse.json returns.

**Files Fixed**:
- `app/api/users/[id]/route.ts`
- `app/api/members/[id]/route.ts`
- `app/api/news/[id]/route.ts`

### Pagination Issues

**Problem**: Some API routes had potential undefined values for pageSize, causing TypeScript errors.

**Solution**: Added default values for pageSize in pagination calculations.

**Files Fixed**:
- `app/api/members/route.ts`
- `app/api/news/route.ts`

## Soft Delete Implementation

### Database Migration Issues

**Problem**: The soft delete functionality was implemented but the database schema hadn't been updated yet.

**Solution**: Temporarily disabled soft delete functionality until database migration is applied.

**Files Fixed**:
- `lib/soft-delete.ts`

### Soft Delete Helper Functions

**Problem**: Soft delete helper functions were trying to use deletedAt fields that don't exist in the database yet.

**Solution**: Modified soft delete helpers to perform hard deletes until database is migrated.

**Files Fixed**:
- `lib/soft-delete.ts`

## Next Steps

1. **Run Database Migration**: Apply the soft delete migration to add deletedAt fields to all tables.
2. **Update Soft Delete Helpers**: After migration, update soft delete helpers to use soft delete functionality.
3. **Test All API Routes**: Ensure all API routes are working correctly with the fixes.
4. **Add Unit Tests**: Add unit tests for the fixed functionality to prevent regressions.

## Verification

After applying these fixes, the application should:

1. Have no TypeScript errors
2. Properly enforce role-based access control
3. Handle errors consistently across all API routes
4. Be ready for soft delete implementation after database migration
